PC Instructions:

1. Download the modpack from the release page:

    https://github.com/limen123/MoM-World-Tour-BGM-Modpack/releases/tag/V1.0
    
2. After extracting, you should end up with a Songs folder. Within it should be BBS, DDD, KH1, KH2, and KH3 folders.

3. Download the batch files from the main page or on the release page:
   
    https://github.com/limen123/MoM-World-Tour-BGM-Modpack/releases/tag/V1.0
    
4. Place the batch files in the same folder as the Songs folder. It should now be together like this:

      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27838339/121298565-18c97a80-c8c2-11eb-8072-c3883ce561b8.png)

5. Run the 1ST STEP batch file located in the pack to create backups of the original BGM track.
	- By default, your game should be in "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\KH_MoM". If it is not, you
	  will have to locate it yourself. Try searching "KH_MoM" if you're having trouble.
    
6. Once you have finished creating backups, run the 2ND STEP batch file located in the pack. For subsequent uses, you ONLY need to run THIS BATCH FILE. You do not need to create backups every time. Make sure you are NOT hovering in World Tour while you replace the track.
	- KH1 will let you choose between original and remastered versions of KH1's Precious Stars in the Sky
	- KH2 will let you choose between original and remastered versions of KH2's A Twinkle in the Sky
	- BBS will replace your World Tour BGM with BBS's The Worlds
	- DDD will replace your World Tour BGM with DDD's World of Dream Drops
	- KH3 will replace your World Tour BGM with KH3's Sky of Wonder
	- Again, if the game directory is not found, it will ask you to insert manually.

SWITCH INSTRUCTIONS

Contents are the same, just working for Switch now!!
Make sure you're running any sort of firmware that allows game mods. I tested this with Atmosphere

1. Download the Switch Pack and extract. You'll end up with 5 folders: KH1, KH2, KH3, BBS, DDD. Decide which one you want to install and navigate into the folder.

2. You should now see a folder with the game's US title ID. Take this folder and copy it into your Atmosphere\contents\ folder or equivalent if using other CFW.
   - If you are looking at KH1 and KH2, there should be 2 subfolders within them called Original and Remaster. Decide which one you want and nagivate into it to find the title ID folder.
   - If you are not running the US version of the game, search online for your version's title ID and rename the folder you want to use beforehand.
